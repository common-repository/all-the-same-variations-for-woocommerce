Helps user experience when variable products have a lot of options, but the user wants to select the same option for them all.

== Description ==

All The Same Variations for WooCommerce is a simple, lightweight plugin which is really helpful when a variable product has a lot of options, but the user wants to select the same option for them all.

When activated at individual product level, this plugin simply inserts an 'All the same' checkbox (label can be changed) below the first variation in the list. Once the user selects the first option and ticks 'All the same' it will then set the rest of the options to the top option value and hide the rest.

Example use: You have a product which is a pick and mix x12 multipack. You provide 12 variations (options) for selection to make up the multipack. However, your shopper wants all 12 options to be the same. All The Same Variations allows the shopper to select the first option and then simply tick a box to fill the remaining 11, rather than having to make 11 further selections before adding to cart.

NOTE: Attribute values are case sensitive so please consider this when setting up attributes.
